P001,Up,Up,Up,Low,Up,"Prices are rising both quarterly and annually, and transaction volumes are also climbing — a strong combination that reflects broad-based confidence. The low off-plan share suggests that activity is being driven by real demand in the ready market rather than speculative pre-sales.

P002,Up,Down,Down,High,Down,"Prices are rising in the short term, but both annual price trends and transaction volumes are declining. This combination often reflects temporary demand spikes, usually driven by off-plan launches or incentives. The high off-plan share suggests speculative buying rather than end-user absorption.
